=============

Solutions for Project Euler problems in whatever language strikes my fancy at the time.

###Formatting
Each problem is in a separate folder, with **notes.md** describing the thought process and **solution.clj** being the "best" solution (by whatever arbitrary criteria I decide upon in the moment). For any other files, the notes should have a section for them and what their purpose is.
